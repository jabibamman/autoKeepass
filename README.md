# Auto Keepass

## Fast password fill for Keepass
This script allows you to avoid typing your Keepass password every time, which saves time!

## Usage/Examples

> Make you sure you have already python and pip installed on your desktop.

-  You have to add  ```KEEPASS_PWD``` into your env variables like this

```KEEPASS_PWD = yourKeepassPwd```

- Next, you need to open your PowerShell terminal in the same directory as the project and type:
```
.\autoKeepass.ps1
```

- Make you sure Keepass is not open in your tabs !

Then you are finally done, you can easily run Keepass without typing your password ;)
