## Fast password fill for Keepass
This script allows you to avoid typing your Keepass password every time, which saves time!

## Usage/Examples

> Make you sure you have already python and pip installed on your desktop.

-  You have to add  ```KEEPASS_PWD``` and ```KEEPASS_PATH``` into your env variables like this

```
KEEPASS_PWD = yourKeepassPwd
KEEPASS_PATH = yourKeepassPathTo/KeePass.exe
 ```

- Next, you need to open your PowerShell terminal in the same directory as the project and type:
```
.\autoKeepass.ps1
```
- Make you sure Keepass is not open in your tabs !

Then you are finally done, you can easily run Keepass without typing your password ;)
